# callback_exercise
google cloud function that triggers on firestore create event on a given path and send an e-mail using some parameters from the firestore document

How to improve the app:

1 - The app opens directly to the home page without any explanation of what it is or what it does, it should probably show an animation or video with a friendly exlpanation of how to use it in the real world.

2 - The about button in the app links to a website, to the main page of the website instead of to the about page of the website, maybe it should show the information in-app or at least link to the about page.

3 - The button "Create new" in "Add account" has a nice looking shiny background image, but it is very pixelated, should use a high definition one instead.

4 - Idk maybe make a widget for the phone app, does anybody use widgets?
